        <u> 06. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
        </u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>ViewState</b><br>

        <b>Session State</b><br>
        >> Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.<br>
        >> In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or
        there is session expiration.<br>
        >> Information is stored on the server.<br>

        </u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        for - loops through a block of code a number of times <br>
        for/in - loops through the properties of an object <br>
        for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object <br>
        while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true <br>
        do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true <br>
    </p>
    <h2><u>11. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</u></h2>

    <h2><u>12. What is the function of the delete operator?</u></h2>
    <p>

        <u> 16. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
        </u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so
        that's why it takes time.
